1. When the program asks for 'Seed Name', it wants the name in Spelunky 2. For example, ABACAB00 is the name of a popular seed.
2. The 'Seed Description' can be anything. You could put anything from 'A seed with a teleporter' to 'A seed that contains exactly 53 bombs, 42 ropes, and 12 turkeys.'
3. When opening a seed file via this program, do not put the file name as 'test.seed'. Just put 'test'.
